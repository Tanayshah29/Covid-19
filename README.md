The global impact of COVID-19

With the rapid spread in the novel corona-virus across countries, the World Health Organisation (WHO)and several countries have published latest results on the impact of COVID-19 over the past few months.
I have been going through many sources and articles to understand the fatality trend and I was excited to come across this data source and decided to see some visualization on the same. The aim here is to understand how visualization helps to derive informative insights from data sources.
For the visualization part, I am using Tableau.

Analysis:

1.The global impact of COVID-19.

2. Descriptive analysis on infected, mortality rate & growth rates from last month.

3. Analysis on spread of COVID-19 between [Dec â€”April ]

4. Analysis based on Cases per country,Deaths per country and daily case count.
